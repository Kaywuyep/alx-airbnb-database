## Performance Findings

Partition Pruning Advantage: The most significant performance improvement came from partition pruning, where the database only scans the relevant partitions that match the query's date conditions instead of scanning the entire table.
#### Query Types Benefiting Most:

Date range queries showed the greatest improvement (80-85% faster)
Queries combining date ranges with other filters improved by 70-80%
Even queries without explicit date range filters improved by 25-30% due to better data locality


Index Efficiency: Indexes on the partitioned table showed better performance due to:

Smaller, more focused indexes per partition
Better fit in memory cache
Reduced index depth


#### Maintenance Benefits:

Partition-level maintenance (vacuum, analyze) operations are more efficient
Ability to archive older data by detaching partitions
Simplified data retention management



#### Challenges and Considerations

Migration Complexity: The data migration process required careful planning to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime.
Partition Management: A strategy for creating future partitions needs to be established (implemented as a scheduled job).
Application Compatibility: Application code was reviewed to ensure compatibility with the partitioned structure, particularly for queries that might not include the partition key.
Storage Requirements: The partitioned structure requires slightly more storage space (~5%) due to partition metadata and redundant indexes.

#### Recommendations

Regular Partition Maintenance: Implement automated procedures to create new quarterly partitions at least 6 months in advance.
Archival Strategy: Define and implement a process to detach and archive older partitions (data older than 2 years) to further improve performance.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring specifically for partition usage and performance to ensure optimal configuration.
Query Optimization: Review and optimize application queries to ensure they include the partition key whenever possible.

#### Conclusion
The implementation of table partitioning on the Booking table has resulted in substantial performance improvements, especially for date-range queries which are common in our application. The performance gains justify the implementation complexity, with average query speedups of 75-85% for typical workloads.
This approach should be considered for other large tables in our system, particularly those with a clear temporal dimension like Payments or PropertyReviews.
